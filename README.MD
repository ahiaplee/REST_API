<h1>SEIS â€“ TEST REST API</h1>

Developed with Python 3.6.9 using WSL for Windows 10
Native Windows not support as Celery does not have support for Windows since 4.0

**Installation:**

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A copy of redis-stable is included but you can delete it and redownload it by running run-redis.sh in a terminal window

**To  run:**

 - **3** Terminal windows are required
 - Start redis with run-redis.sh
 - Start API server with run-server.sh
 - Start Celery worker with run-celery.sh

<h2>API</h2>

All requests only support POST as the JWT in this context is not single use.

All requests return a Message Object like this example below:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "User account created",
    "data": null
}
```
